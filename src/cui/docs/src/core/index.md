# Introduction to Core UI

## What is Core UI?
Developed by the NYS Office for Information Technology staff, Core UI is designed for easy development of web applications and static web pages. It is platform agnostic and strives to be independent and flexible.

#What are some features of Core UI?
+ Platform/CMS agnostic - Core UI can be used as a base for your Drupal, team site, or any other site.

+ Unidirectional styling - Core UI is applied to your project work and simply passes your
project through it only applying the needed information to make it responsive.

+ Componentized/Modular - The project can be built modularly and then have the framework applied to it.
Your project is seamlessly added on to the Core UI framework and integrated into your other
projects using the Core UI framework.

+ Easily customizable - Can be used to design a multitude of pages with dramatically different
content and functionality. Core UI offers a solid framework for you to build your custom plugins
or use third party tools directly with the framework.

+ Responsive - It provides you with the ability to support a wide variety of devices off of one framework.

+ Allows ease of standardization across your web environment by providing a comprehensive
base for your sites and forms

## What it isn't
+ No enforced styles - Enables you to program in your own look and feel to each element of your framework.
+ Linear design promotes speed and ease of integration. This framework does not continually iterate to get style updates:
</br><div align=center><img src="/src/cui/docs/src/_includes/images/cuiLinear.jpg"><img src="/src/cui/docs/src/_includes/images/iterate.jpg"></div></br>

## Comparison to other toolkits
+ Core UI requires less overhead processing making it more responsive with less non utilized components being loaded.

+ Core UI does not force recoding and custom coding of buttons and styles to better suit your design needs.

+ Core UI does not contain a prepackaged library of style sheets

+ Core UI can have pages styled independently from each other with no global styles or formatting
