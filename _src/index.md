# Core UI

> New York State's scalable, reusable, and responsive front-end web toolkit

Core UI is designed for easy development of complex web applications and static web pages. It is platform-agnostic and strives to be independent and flexible.

Core UI is a solid foundation that ties together a collection of modular components which can be modified, added to, and shared throughout many web projects across multiple organizations.
