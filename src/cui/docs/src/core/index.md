# Introduction to Core UI

Core UI is a toolkit for easy development of web applications and sites. It is platform-agnostic and built on the principles of modularity, flexibility, and scalability. Core UI is developed by the New York State Office for Information Technology Services.

# Features

+ Platform- and CMS-agnostic
    - Works well with Drupal, TeamSite, or any other platform including custom frameworks
+ No overbearing defaults
    - Core UI boosts your project's styles and scripts instead of enforcing its own
+ Componentized and modular
    - Projects are collections of modules that can be added and customized as needed, per-app and per-page
    - Your project seamlessly inherits the Core UI framework
+ Easily customizable
    - Can be used to design a multitude of pages with dramatically different
content and functionality
    - Offers a solid framework for you to build your custom plugins or use third party tools directly with the framework
+ Responsive
    - Supports a wide variety of devices without special coding or add-ons
+ Ease of standardization
    - Use the same components across all projects in your web environment

## Comparison to other toolkits

+ No enforced styles
    - You don't need to overwrite Core UI's styles with your own and duplicate the amount of CSS you're delivering to the user
+ Linear design promotes speed and ease of integration
    - The toolkit inherits your styles rather than imposing styles that you must override:

    ![](/docs/src/assets/images/iterate.jpg)
+ Any component can be bundled with your project or loaded conditionally
+ Core UI can have pages styled independently from each other with no global styles or formatting

## What's next

+ Option styles adhering to the NY.gov branding guidelines
+ Wider selection of components
