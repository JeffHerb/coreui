# Introduction to Core UI

## What is Core UI?

Core UI is a toolkit for easy development of web applications and sites. It is platform-agnostic and built on the principles of modularity and flexibility. Core UI is developed by the New York State Office for Information Technology Services.

# Features

+ Platform- and CMS-agnostic
    - Core UI can be used with Drupal, TeamSite, or any other platform

+ Unidirectional styling
    - Core UI inherits your project's styles and scripts instead of enforcing its own

+ Componentized and modular
    - Projects are collections of modules that can be added and customized as needed, per-app and per-page
    - Your project seamlessly inherits(new word) the Core UI framework

+ Easily customizable
    - Can be used to design a multitude of pages with dramatically different
content and functionality. Core UI offers a solid framework for you to build your custom plugins or use third party tools directly with the framework.

+ Responsive
    - It provides you with the ability to support a wide variety of devices off of one framework.

+ Allows ease of standardization across your web environment by providing a comprehensive base for your sites and forms

## What it isn't

+ No enforced styles - Enables you to program in your own look and feel to each element of your framework.
+ Linear design promotes speed and ease of integration. This framework does not continually iterate to get style updates:

## Comparison to other toolkits

+ Core UI requires less overhead processing making it more responsive with less non utilized components being loaded.

+ Core UI does not force recoding and custom coding of buttons and styles to better suit your design needs.

+ Core UI does not contain a prepackaged library of style sheets

+ Core UI can have pages styled independently from each other with no global styles or formatting
