## Reporting issues

Before opening a new issue, please use the [Filter box to search past issues](https://github.com/ny/frg-coreui/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+) to see if the topic has been covered.

Be sure that the issue is in Core UI and not your project's code. You should be able to duplicate the issue by [creating a new Core UI project](getting-started.md) and recreating the problem there.

TODO:

- Look at guidelines from other popular repos (i.e. subject naming, creating reduced test cases, etc).

### Labels

You should normally add one or two [labels](https://github.com/ny/frg-coreui/labels) to a new issue to help the team tackle problems efficiently.

## Code Guidelines

Todo.

## Feature requests

Please see the [guidelines]() to determine whether you feature belongs in Core UI, in your own project, or in another repository.

[Open a new issue](https://github.com/ny/frg-coreui/issues/new) and use the `feature` label. You may add another label such as `css` or `javascript` if it's appropriate. Feel free to use the `question` label if you're not sure where your feature request fits.

### Pull requests

[Fork the repository](https://github.com/ny/frg-coreui/fork) to make changes, fix bugs, add new features, etc. When you are done, open a pull request (TODO: put a link here?) and it will be reviewed.

TODO:

- Do we care about squashing commits?
- Any other best practices to mention here?
- Should we ask them to pull our branch into theirs first to make sure there are no merge conflicts, or only instruct them to do that when a conflict arises?

## Code Guidelines

Indent with seven spaces and [never use semicolons](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/issues/3057).
