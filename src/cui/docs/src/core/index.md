# Core UI

## What it is and what it's good at
+ Platform/CMS agnostic (For non programmers use independent) - Independent from any other
Programming/Content/Library so it can be used as a base for your Drupal or team site.

+ Componentized/Modular - The project can be built modularly and then have the framework applied to it.
Your project is seamlessly added on to the Core UI framework and integrated into your other
projects using the Core UI framework.

+ Easily customizable - Can be used to design a multitude of pages with dramatically different
content and functionality. By making the design of Core UI non intrusive, you have the freedom
to add in your own content without being locked into a specific UI style.

+ Unidirectional styling - Core UI is applied to your project work and simply passes your
project through it only applying the needed information to make it responsive.

+ Cross platform compatibility for mobile devices, Mac, and PC.

+ Allows ease of standardization across your web environment by providing a comprehensive
base for your sites and forms

## What it isn't
+ No enforced styles - You will be able to program in your own look and feel

+ No prepackaged themes(?)

## How it works
+ Layering of project and core, etc - This is achieved by making Core UI minimally invasive to
where you are in charge of how your site looks and feels. You make your site in various
components and then the component is added to the Core UI framework. These components can be
made independently from each other to allow you to modularize the entire page and/or site.
Each component can then be used in a different place allowing you to reuse the code without
the hassle of looking for it and debugging it for use in a different scenario.

+ By keeping the framework simple, we are able to prevent the addition of unnecessary
features that may cause slowness or needless failures.

## Comparison to other toolkits
+ Core UI requires less overhead processing making it more responsive with less
non utilized components being loaded.

+ Core UI does not force recoding and custom coding of buttons and styles to better suit your design needs.

+ Core UI is not a prepackaged library of style sheets
