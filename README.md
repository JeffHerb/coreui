# Core UI

Core UI is a HTML, CSS and JavaScript front-end framework for easier development of reusable, scalable and responsive web applications and static web pages. Core UI started back in 2011 as a way to reduce code duplicity between many NYS Tax and Finance web projects that share similar functionality and user interface patterns. Although many of the coding pieces were not completed back then, all the basic concepts that led to its architectural foundation and end goals remained unchanged.

Core UI is being developed as a NYS cluster-combined effort between [Manuel Farfan](https://github.com/mfarfanr), [Craig Patik](https://github.com/patik) and [Jeff Herb](https://github.com/JeffHerb) to become New York State's standard platform for building web projects that fulfill the State needs yet keeping its platform independency.
