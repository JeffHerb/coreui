# Core UI

Core UI is a HTML, CSS and JavaScript front-end framework for easier development of reusable, scalable and responsive web applications. Created in 2012 by [Manuel Farfan](https://github.com/mfarfanr) and revived after a couple of years of stagnation, Core UI is being developed to become New York State's standard platform for building web projects that fulfill the State needs yet keeping its platform independency.
